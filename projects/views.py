Views for the 'projects' app.

This file contains the "business logic" that handles web requests
and returns responses. It includes:

Function-Based Views (FBVs) for simple, read-only pages (e.g., index, about).

Class-Based Views (CBVs) for handling complex, model-based
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for Projects.
